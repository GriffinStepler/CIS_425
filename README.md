# CIS_425
A repository of all work from CIS 425, which focused on web design and asynchronous programming with Node JS. 
Exercises: Guided exercises meant to introduce concepts. 
Assignments: Roughly outlined but limited guidance, used as an introduction to self-guided coding. 
Projects: Larger in scale and completely self designed, these wholly represent my work.
