Links
	When linking to an internal webpage on your own site, use relative
	When linking to an external page or file, use absolute paths

Semantic and nonsemantic tags
	Added semantic tags in HTML5
	Semantic tags are those that give MEANING - they indicate what the content of the tag might be (this is broad)
		they don't natively do anything (though certain ones are rendered in special ways, like emphasis)
	Nonsemantic just give formatting, with little indication to the content

<div></div>
	This tag is used to organize content into chunks
	Give precendent to specailized div tags (like aside, footer, etc.)

Block level vs. Inline tags
	<span> is an inline tag - it does not create a new line or enter a new block
	<p> is a block level tage - it creates a new block for the contained content

The descendent selector is the SPACE character

Float elements
	floats remove items from the normal flow of html
	float: left; makes an element move to the left of the container and allows other elements to wrap on the right
