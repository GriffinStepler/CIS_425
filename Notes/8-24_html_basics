File Systems - Windows and Mac OS
    Typically, server side uses Unix structure

    Unix and Windows organize file systems differently
        Windows uses volumes - logical separations of files (versus physical separations)
        You need to know which drive and directory (and name) the file is in
        Paths/file names are not case sensitive
        Windows 10 uses NTFS (networking file system) by default
        File Allocation Table 32 (FAT32) is an older Windows file system, but still used on certain media
        Windows uses virtual folders; the path can differ from the GUI path

        Mac OS uses strict divisions in folders; Applications go into Applications, Documents into Documents, and prefernces and support files in Library
        Uses HFS+ or APFS
        Macs can read and write to FAT32, but only read from NTFS
