	<h1>The Back of the New $20 Bill</h1>

	<main>
		<div id="twentyBill"><img src="./20billsecurity.jpg" alt="bill security" style="border: solid"></div>

		<p>Have you seen the "updated" $20 Notes? The U.S. Treasury has rolled out another revamp of the U.S. twenty dollar bill in an effort to stop those counterfeiters once and for all. It features high-tech fake-busting elements like a watermark, a security thread, and color-shifting ink.</p>
	
		<p>We are not going to concern ourselves with a critique of the front of the bill. It's the <strong>back</strong> of the note that's unusual.</p>
	
		<h2>Too Many 20s!!!</h2>
	
		<p><img src="twenties.gif" width="90" height="140" alt="20s closeup"/><p>
		<p>In particular, it's the random placement of all those little 20s in the white space that are of particular concern.</p>
	
		<p>Are they supposed to be another security feature? Did they let a novice at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing design it? No one knows!</p>
	
		<h2>Connect-the-Dots</h2>
		<p>There must be more to it. Perhaps the new 20s contain subliminal connect-the-dots messages, like tiny constellations. Or, maybe the 20s connect to form a secret message. Again, no one knows!</p>
	
		<p>You are all encouraged to get a new $20 bill, connect the dots to find the message on the back, and compare it to the suggestions by other when you visit the (imaginary) site <strong>newTwenties.org</strong>.</p>
